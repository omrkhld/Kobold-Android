# Kobold Fight Club for Android
[Kobold Fight Club](http://kobold.club) is an Encounter builder and manager for the popular tabletop RPG, Dungeons & Dragons. It is primarily used by Dungeon Masters as a tool to facilitate smoother and more balanced combat.
With the permission of its developer, [Ian Toltz](https://github.com/Asmor), this project is the Android app for Kobold Fight Club. The app supports devices running Android 4.4+, and is optimized for phones of all shapes and sizes.

## Source
The source code in this repository reflects the app as of September 2016.

## Features
With the app, you can:
* Create encounters by adding monsters from a list.
* Filter through the list of monsters by name or CR.
* Create your party by adding your players.
* Run encounters.

The above features will continue to be refined as the app undergoes thorough user testing (mainly by myself when I use it during my games). More features will be considered.

## How to Work with the Source
Currently the source code is a mess and is probably only comprehensible by me. I will endeavor to make it more develop-friendly once the basic functionality of the app has been fully established. Until then, do bear with me as I continue pushing uncommented code.

Since this is an open source project, do feel free to submit a pull request and assist in reporting and fixing bugs that you might see along the way.
